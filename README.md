# SpringBootRestApi

Created by Christine Cao

This is a way to use Spring Boot to create REST APIs.

I use mvn clean install to generate the jar file to run the embedde Tomcat server 
then type localhost:8080 in a brower to do GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations. Use Google Advanced REST Client (ARC) to send requests.
